BillReminder 0.3
==============================

* This was a massive rewrite of the entire application, and instead
of listing all files that have been changd, I'll try to highlight
the most important changes and features instead.
* GLADE: BillReminder 0.3 was entirely re-written in order to remove
all glade files and dependencies. The initial idea was to simply 
get rid of the dependency, but it also served as a learning process
for me (and I believe the other contributors will agree with this
as well).
* DBUS: The DBUS layer received a bit more love from Luiz Armesto,
breaking it down into the proper calls so to separate the 'engine'
per se from the client.
* UI: The user interface has also gone a series of changes and
(hopefully) improvements. It is probably not 100% HIG compliant yet,
but we'll gladly accept suggestions.
* Bug management: Towards the last 8 weeks of development we've adopted
the habit of filing bug reports prior to fixing the issues that we
encountered during the development cycle.
* Translations: All prior contributors promptly replied to my email
asking them to update their translations:
