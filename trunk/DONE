Road to a 0.3 release:

* Make sure to update categorie combobox in adddialog with category selected from categorydialog or original value if user clicked on cancel button in categorydialog.
* Finish categoriesdialog so that it allows the user to associate a color (use gtk.ColorButton?) to a category.
  * Create a categoriesview class (inherit genericview) to display a colored square (pixbuf) and the name of the category (string).
* Finish alarm dialog so that user can select date and time for individual record.

*  Add an "action" to the notification message, allowing the user to open/start BillReminder to work on his bills.  This has to detect if an instance of BillReminder is already running or not.  If running, display it; else, launch it.
*  Use all icons created by vdpizzol and add them to the setup script.
