Road to a 0.3 release:

* Finish categoriesdialog so that it allows the user to associate a color (use gtk.ColorButton?) to a category.
  * Create a categoriesview class (inherit genericview) to display a colored square (pixbuf) and the name of the category (string).
* Make sure that maindialog also displays the category name and the colored image.
* Finish alarm dialog so that user can select date and time for individual record.
* Add verification routine to adddialog so that amount and category are validated prior to saving/updating a record.

*  Feature to allow user to choose when to be reminded for a given bill;

*  Test and strengthen the updatetables method in DAL;
*  Table validation should take the version into account when making decisions.  If version in code is less than existing (in the db), we should not update;

*  Add a method of payment to database and UI, so user can select the method of payment for any given record.  For exemple, credit card, cash, check, etc.  In case of payment by check, allow user to enter the check number;  This should be good enough for this iteration;
